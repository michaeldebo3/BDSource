    static let statementOfTheProblem = "     Few would deny that receiving a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder (BD-I) is a frightening and often tragic experience for patients and their families.  Bipolar disorder has the highest rate of suicide out of any mental illness (Ilgen et al., 2010) with some studies showing a suicide completion rate exceeding 20% (Baldessarini et al., 2012).  Individuals with BD-I are 20 to 30 times more likely to commit suicide than the general population (Pompili et al., 2013), and between one-third and one-half attempt suicide in their lifetime (Gonda et al., 2012).  At any one time, 30 to 40% of individuals with BD I experience suicidal ideation and 80% will experience suicidal ideation in their lifetime (Slama et al., 2004).\n\n     Dating back to Emil Kraepelin’s description a century ago, bipolar disorder has long been considered a relapsing and remitting condition (Kraepelin, 1921).  After their initial manic episode, more than 90% of those diagnosed with bipolar disorder will have subsequent manic, mixed or depressive episodes, with most relapsing multiple times (Begley et al., 2001). Although mood episodes themselves contribute in undeniable ways to the intense suffering associated with BD-I, remission is far from a return to normalcy for most.  The BD-I population spends about 20% of their lives in a mood episode (Angst & Sellaro, 2000), and around half their lives symptomatic (Joffe et al., 2004), usually in the form of depressive symptomology (Judd et al., 2002).\n\n     The functional impairment associated with having BD-I is severe, with bipolar disorder ranked the ninth leading medical cause of global disability despite its low prevalence (World Health Organization, 2001).  Between 30% and 60% of individuals with BD-I never return to their premorbid level of vocational and social functionality (MacQueen, Young, and Joffe, 2001), which likely relates to BD-I often being associated with substantial cognitive deficits that worsen with time (Gildengers et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2006) and intense stigma (Hawke, Parikh, & Michalak, 2013; Jamison, 2006).  These may be some of the reasons why the subjective quality of life (QoL) for those with a BD-I diagnosis has been shown to be worse than schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (Michalak, Yatham, & Lam, 2005).\n\n     Neither the standard of care nor top-of-the-line care is able to help the vast majority of people living with Bipolar I Disorder (BD-I) achieve a quality of life that is comparable to the general population (Amini & Sharifi, 2012; IsHak et al., 2012; Michalak et al., 2005).  Medication is currently the mainstay of treatment, with an increasing number of experts acknowledging the importance of providing certain psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions for the best care possible (Nolen, 2015; Scott & Colom, 2005; Smith, Whitman, & Ghaemi, 2012; Vieta, 2005).  Most who are fully compliant with their medication and treatment experience frequent relapses (Goldberg & Harrow, 2003; Gitlin et al., 1995), struggle with residual depressive symptomology (e.g., suicidal ideation) during remission (Judd et al., 2002), and endure psychosocial impairment in occupational, academic, social, and/or marital domains (Bonnin et al., 2014; Burdick, Goldberg, & Harrow, 2010; Coryell et al., 1993; Judd et al., 2008; MacQueen, Young, & Joffe, 2001; Rosa et al., 2009).  The most effective psychosocial interventions available to date have been associated with lower relapse rates and improved psychosocial functioning in the short-term (Beynon et al., 2008; Colom et al., 2003; Geddes & Miklowitz, 2013; Lam et al., 2003; Lam et al., 2009; Miklowitz et al., 2003; Parikh et al., 2015; Scott 1995; Scott & Colom, 2005; Scott, Colom, & Vieta, 2007; Vieta & Colom, 2004), but these treatment options are not readily available to most living with BD-I.  Perhaps more disconcerting is that these interventions appear to have few to no lasting beneficial effects (Vieta et al., 2009)."
    
    static let bipolarDisorderOverview = "     Bipolar disorder is often used interchangeably with manic-depression, but there is an important distinction in terminology that is appreciated by few (Ghaemi & Dalley, 2014).  While there have been people dating as far back as ancient Greece and throughout much of history who have attempted to describe and conceptualize aspects of severe mental illness that appears quite similar to BD-I, many consider Kraepelin to be the forefather of modern day psychiatry whose ground-breaking work laid the foundation for current understanding of BD-I by mental health practitioners (Angst & Marneros, 2001). Originally described as manic-depression insanity, Kraepelin’s 1921 definition mandated that there be a recurrence of at least 10 mood episodes, irrespective of polarity (Goodwin & Jamison, 2007).  This meant that a person who had 10 depressive episodes without a manic episode would have been considered to have manic-depressive illness (Ghaemi & Dalley, 2014). It was later revised to manic-depression illness in order to include a majority without psychosis (Ghaemi & Dalley, 2014).  In the 1950s, Leonhard (1957) articulated a distinction between bipolar and unipolar recurrent psychosis, which was broadened by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis during the 60s and 70s to include nonpsychotic individuals, termed bipolar illness and unipolar depressive illness (Woodruff, Goodwin, & Guze, 1974).  The DSM-III broadened the conceptualization of unipolar and bipolar depression to include what the DSM-II had called “neurotic depression,” and labeled every mental illness a disorder so as not having to discern those whose etiology were primarily organic from those that were primarily psychological in nature (Ghaemi & Dalley, 2014).  These changes meant a shift from Kraepelin’s original conceptualization that emphasized the recurrence of a severely debilitating medical condition towards a diagnosis based on polarity, which was inclusive of cases with less severe symptomology and meant being less focused on its biological origin.\n\n     Consistent with the relatively recent historical shift towards focusing on polarity for diagnosis, much more attention is typically given to the manic phase of BD-I rather than the depressive episodes, despite the latter typically occurring much more frequently and for longer duration (Judd et al., 2002; Kupka et al., 2003; Perlis et al., 2006).  Most suicides occur during depressive episodes, and the risk of suicide is highest during a depressive episode, especially during agitated states that frequently occur during a “mixed” episode consisting of both manic and depressive symptoms (Hawton et al., 2005; Holma et al., 2014; Valtonen et al., 2008).  From a historical perspective, one might appreciate why individuals with BD-I typically experience many more depressive episodes than the people suffering from the 20-fold more prevalent form of unipolar depression, with their higher rates of relapse appearing to be a particularly salient factor contributing to this population’s substantially higher rate of suicide (Holma et al., 2014).\n\n     Although most people with BD-I spend significantly more time in a state of depression than mania, the latter is almost invariably experienced as a highly aversive state that has been the subject of many myths.  Many lay people and a significant portion of mental health professionals believe mania is typically experienced as highly enjoyable, with the majority of people with BD-I desiring subsequent manic episodes once mania subsides.  That may be true for some people living with BD-II whose hypomanic episodes are often much more benign. In reality, mania is most often a frightening, fearful and highly debilitating experience that the majority of people with BD-I remember with strong aversion and desperately want to avoid experiencing again. Studies have reliably shown manic episodes are more often than not characterized by a persistent dysphoria and/or features indicative of a depressed mood (Cassidy et al., 1998; Dilsaver et al., 1999; Gonzalez-Pinto et al., 2003; Sato et al., 2002).  More importantly, psychosis is present in three out of every four manic episodes (Tohen, Waternaux, and Tsuang, 1990), and manifests more often than any other symptom typically found in mania (Gupta et al., 2009). Following a manic episode people are often left feeling demoralized around having “lost their mind” or “having gone crazy” and dread the prospect of it happening again.  In addition, mania is characterized by high levels of impulsivity (Moeller et al., 2001; Najt et al., 2007; Swann et al., 2001b). This impulsive behavior often leads to high-risk, destructive behavior, which may result in job loss, financial costs, and disruptions in interpersonal relationships.  These consequences can become irreversible, sometimes resulting in incarceration, significant and lasting physical harm, and/or even death to oneself or another. After a manic episode, a person is at a heightened risk of having a subsequent depressive episode as he or she is often left not only grappling with shame and embarrassment around having engaged in psychotic and destructive behavior, but also having to adjust to serious, adverse psychosocial consequences that can be permanent.\n\n     In addition to a chronic threat of relapse and pervasive subsyndromal symptomology, the functional impairment associated with having BD-I is substantial and pervasive (Burdick et al., 2010; Judd et al., 2008).  In many ways, the severity of their psychosocial impairment cannot be understated.  Approximately 30 to 60% of individuals never return to their premorbid level of functionality following their first manic episode (MacQueen, Young, and Joffe, 2001). Those with BD-I are twice as likely to be divorced or unmarried as the general population (Coryell et al., 1993).  Even during remission, most people with BD-I report a significantly lower social life and social support than the average American (Bauwens et al., 1991; Serretti et al., 1999). With regards to occupational functioning, the majority with BD-I exhibit substantial impairment at work (Reed et al., 2010; Tse & Walsh, 2001). The World Mental Health Initiative found the illness is associated with a greater loss of disability-adjusted life-years than any major neurological disease and all forms of cancer (Merikangas et al., 2011).  Their psychosocial impairment is linked, in part, to adverse effects associated with subsyndromal symptom exacerbation and relapse (Altshuler et al., 2002; Burdick, Goldberg, & Harrow, 2010; Proudfoot et al., 2014; Rosa et al., 2009). However, the intensity and prevalence of impairment largely endures during euthymia (Coryell et al., 1993; Dion et al., 1998; Judd et al., 2002; Judd et al., 2005; Rosa et al., 2008; Tohen et al., 2000), and is much worse than for those remitted from recurrent unipolar depression (Chacko, Narayan, & Prabhavathy, 2011).  The psychosocial impairment in the BD-I population is often be attributed to neuropsychological dysfunction that endures during euthymia (Arts et al., 2008; Bora, Yucel, & Pantelis, 2009; Dickerson et al., 2004; Dittmann et al., 2008; Elshahawi et al., 2011; Henry, Minassian, & Perry, 2013; Lewandowski et al., 2013; Malhi et al., 2007; Olley et al., 2005; Peters et al., 2014 Robinson et al., 2006; Samame et al., 2013; Torres et al., 2007), manifesting as deficits in at least one major domain of cognitive functioning for approximately two out every three individuals with BD-I (Martin et al., 2008; Martino et al., 2014). Additionally, routine disturbances in sleep undermine functionality not just during mania and depression, but euthymia as well (Giglio et al., 2009; Gruber et al., 2009; Harvey, 2011; Walz et al., 2013).  Lastly, the intense stigma associated with a diagnosis of BD-I is a major contributing factor that confounds the psychosocial impairment in BD-I population (Brohan et al., 2011; Cerit et al., 2012; Latalova et al., 2013; Sarisoy, et al., 2013; Thome et al., 2012; Vazquez et al., 2011)."
    
    static let circadianRhythms = "     Often referred to as the body’s internal clock, circadian rhythms refer to an array of biological processes that fluctuate and cycle over the span of 24 hours (Mansour, Monk, & Nimgaonkar, 2005).  To list just a fraction of the components of human physiology involved in the system, circadian rhythms include periodic fluctuations in levels of certain, salient hormones, neurotransmitter, and neuropeptides (Balsalobre et al., 2000; Chung, Son, & Kim, 2011; Hampp et al., 2008; Wiz-Justice, 1987), the nature of the body’s physiological stress response (Dickmeis, 2009), the manner and extent of any activation to the autonomic nervous system (Burgess et al., 1997), changes in metabolism (Asher & Schibler, 2011), amount and quality of cellular regeneration (Brown, 1991; Matsuo et al., 2003; Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2008), important intracellular changes (e.g., second messenger signaling (Buhr & Takahashi, 2013), protein expression (Levi & Schibler, 2007), and epigenetic modifications (Bellet & Sassone-Corsi, 2010)).  These physiological processes interact in such a way as to directly influence the patterns of neurotransmission that often impacts a person’s mood (Hampp et al., 2008), the degree to which neurons and skeletal muscle are primed to be activated or become activated—thereby affecting cognition, emotion, and psychomotor activity, one’s overall activity level, appetite (Takahashi et al., 2008), whether one is awake versus sleep (or alert verse drowsy) (Dijk & Czeisler, 1994), how body and mind are affected by stress (Corbett et al., 2006), and perhaps most importantly in the context of BD-I, the quality and quantity of one’s sleep (Cajochen, Krauchi, & Wirz-Justice, 2003).  While circadian rhythms describe the body’s daily physiological changes, in healthy people these molecular, cellular and system wide interactions work to promote the body’s overall homeostasis (i.e. its baseline state of equilibrium), as well as the restoration of cells, tissues and organs that is needed for continued optimal functioning.  There are numerous diseases affecting the body’s circadian rhythms that speak to its importance in both physical and mental health (Froy, 2010; Grandin, Alloy, & Abramson, 2006; Jagannath, Peirson, & Foster, 2013; Lamont et al., 2010).  Several of these pathologies highlight how there can be a wide variation in the particular aspect(s) to this system that represent their particular etiology, corresponding to differing forms of pathophysiology that manifest unique constellations of physical and psychological symptoms (Takahashi et al., 2008).\n\n     Most, if not all, forms of mental illness have an important organic basis that should not be ignored. When it comes to bipolar disorder, there appears to be especially salient biological underpinnings. There is an approximate 40-43% risk that an identical (monozygotic) twin of a person with BD-I will have, or later develop, the disorder (Kieseppa et al., 2004; McGuffin et al., 2003). That is an eight-fold higher risk than for non-identical (dizygotic) twins where there is a similar amount of shared environmental exposure but substantial differences to their genetic composition (Kieseppa et al., 2004; McGuffin et al., 2003). The genetic predisposition towards developing BD-I is comparable in scope to what is seen in schizophrenia (Cannon et al., 1998; Cardno et al., 1999).  BD-I has an approximately 30% greater heritability than occurs in unipolar depression (McGuffin et al., 1996), and it is 2-3 times more heritable than the most prevalent and debilitating anxiety disorders (Domschke & Deckert, 2012).  Yet its salient genetic basis is far from a form of biological determinism where one’s DNA at conception will invariably produce the phenotypic expression of BD-I irrespective of environmental interaction.  After all, the majority of people who share the exact sequence of DNA at birth as someone who develops BD-I will never develop BD-I (Kieseppa et al., 2004; McGuffin et al., 2003). From a biological perspective, this is due to differences in their genetic interaction with environment leading to an array of prolonged or permanent changes to the genetic expression in one case but not the other (Maciukiewicz et al., 2014).\n\n     There is substantial evidence to suggest that many with BD-I have genetic anomalies in their circadian rhythms that affect their functioning and contribute to their symptom presentation in salient ways (Jagannath, Peirson, & Foster; 2013; McClung, 2007; Mitterauer, 2000; Murray & Harvey, 2010; Shi et al., 2008; Soria et al., 2010). While much of the genetic research has focused on genes that theoretically could impact one’s system of circadian rhythms, there is also a clear possibility that they describe a pathophysiology and phenotypic presentation that is largely distinct from the genes involved in maintaining the body’s circadian rhythms (Craddock & Sklar, 2013).  However, recent developments in genetic research have demonstrated that there are a substantial portion of people with BD-I who have DNA mutations affecting the genetic blueprints for the body’s circadian rhythms and therefore its functionality (Soria et al., 2010).  In fact, the salience of abnormal genetics to the body’s circadian rhythms in the pathophysiology of BD-I may not be fully appreciated by most.  Duffy and colleagues (2014) found those with one bipolar parent were at a higher risk for sleeping disorders than bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders relative to age-matched controls.  Certain genetic differences common to BD-I underlie functional abnormalities in melatonin production (Etain et al., 2012a), glucocorticoid levels (Cervantes et al., 2001), the activity of the central pacemaker of circadian rhythms within the hypothalamus (Lamont et al., 2010; Severino et al., 2009; Soria et al., 2010), as well as peripheral pacemaker activity (Yang et al., 2009). This has important implications in BD-I for their abnormal characteristic sleeping patterns (Harvey, 2008), course of illness (Robillard, Naismith, & Hickie, 2013), the constellation of psychological and behavioral symptoms that often manifest (Rybakowski et al., 2014), this population’s tendency towards mixed states (Lee, Son, & Geum, 2013), and even aspects of personality that frequently manifest (Rybakowski et al., 2014). Indeed, different profiles of circadian dysfunction appear related to characteristic differences in temperamental features, mood and symptom expression, as well as specific health risks in BD-I (Aydin et al., 2013; Rybakowski et al., 2014).\n\n     Sleep impairment has been shown to predict poor psychosocial functioning and severity of manic and depressive symptoms at two-year follow-up (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2012). Gruber and colleagues (2011) found reduced total sleep time to be associated with increased severity of mania at 12-month follow up, while increased variability in sleep predicted greater severity of mania and depression. Roybal et al. (2007) performed a CLOCK gene manipulation in mice that resulted in manic behavior, which they were able to reverse via lithium administration. Further substantiating the link between abnormal circadian rhythms, sleep deprivation and mania, Novakova and colleagues (2015) recently found there to be elevated levels of melatonin during the day during mania relative to periods of remission, depression, and healthy controls.\n\n     Genetic anomalies associated with dysfunctional circadian rhythms and their associated aberrant sleeping patterns may play a salient role in understanding psychosis. Mansour et al. (2006) found many of the same genetic mutations associated circadian dysfunction in BD-I also present in schizoaffective and schizophrenic populations where psychosis is substantially more prevalent and sleep is often affected in similar ways. Healthy Americans have been shown to exhibit psychotic or psychotic-like symptoms when heavily sleep deprived (Petrovsky et al., 2014).  There is a well-known phenomenon associated with sleep deprivation known as the “REM-rebound effect” where the time until the onset of REM-sleep (i.e. sleep’s dreaming phase) is dramatically reduced, often bypassing some of the prerequisite phases of sleep that normally manifest while others presenting for a reduced duration. Further, the dreams that are associated with this phenomenon are often vivid nightmares. Some theorize that part of the effectiveness associated with antipsychotic medication is their ability to suppress the REM-rebound effect, thereby preventing the “merging of the dream and real world” (Lima et al., 2008).\n\n     The poor quality of sleep found in BD-I appears to be a salient feature behind the associated poor psychosocial functioning, and likely relates to its adverse effects on emotion regulation, impulsivity, and cognition. Sleep deprivation has been reliably shown to adversely affect emotion regulation in healthy controls (Dinges et al., 1997; Vandekerckhove & Cluydts, 2010; Zohar et al., 2005). Yoo and colleagues (2007) appears to have highlighted some of the important neurobiology behind sleep deprivation in healthy controls with his finding of “an amplified, hyper-limbic response to negative emotional stimuli” that was “associated with a loss of functional connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex.” Interestingly, these distinctions weren’t seen when looking at neutral or positive stimuli. While there is a clear association between sleep deprivation and increased expression of negative affect and mood in healthy Americans (Kahn-Greene et al., 2007), this association appears to be especially pronounced in people with BD-I.  Gershon and colleagues (2012) found longer latency in sleep onset, longer wakefulness after sleep onset, and diminished sleep efficiency were more reliably and intensely associated with negative affect in people with BD-I than was seen when these disruptions in sleep occur in healthy controls.  In fact, virtually every neurological and psychiatric disorder associated with sleep disruption is closely tied to symptoms of emotional dysregulation (Benca et al., 1992). Not surprisingly, sleep deprivation has a similar adverse effects on impulsivity (Anderson & Platten, 2011), often undermining how well a person can adeptly carry out social behaviors as his or her ability to inhibit aggression is typically compromised (Kahn-Greene et al., 2006).\n\n     Given the importance of circadian rhythms for a broad range of salient physiological processes, it is not surprising that some posit circadian dysfunction in BD-I as “a unifying explicatory model for the high psychiatric and medical comorbidity observed during the long-term course of the disorder” (Soreca, 2014).  After controlling for their higher rate of suicide, individuals with BD-I die approximately 7 years earlier than the general population (Crump et al., 2013).  Their shorten lifespans reflect being at an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, influenza, pneumonia, and various forms of cancer (BarChana et al., 2008; Crump et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Weiner, Warren, & Fiedorowicz, 2011).  The elevated risk of contracting some of these life-threatening illnesses—especially influenza, pneumonia and cancer—are likely related to how chronic poor sleep and circadian dysfunction weakens the immune system (Bovbjerg, 2003; Cermakian et al., 2013; Lange, Dimitrov, & Born, 2010).  Additionally, a dysfunctional circadian system may predispose to cancer by undermining the normal regulation of the cell cycle of at-risk cells or cancer cells via mechanisms that are independent of the immune system (e.g., via inappropriately promoting or suppressing certain CLOCK-induced epigenetic cell modifications) (Fu & Kettner, 2013; Greene, 2012; Kelleher, Rao, & Maguire, 2014; Kettner, Katchy, & Fu, 2014; Fritscki et al., 2011; Masri, Kinouchi, Sassone-Corsi, 2015; Sancar et al., 2014).\n\n     The heightened risk of individuals with BD-I dying prematurely from natural causes—especially in relation to developing heart disease, diabetes, or suffering a fatal heart attack or stroke—is likely related to the effects that chronic poor sleep and aberrant circadian functioning have on the body’s metabolism, its cardiovascular functioning and reactivity (Nader, Chrousos, & Kino, 2010), oxidative stress, and a tendency to promote unhealthy behaviors.  Disrupted or aberrant circadian rhythms have been shown to affect how the liver processes both stored and circulating sugar, the extent to which glucose and lipids are released into the blood stream, the body’s overall cellular receptivity to absorbing blood sugar, and the extent to which the body accumulates visceral fat (Nader, Chrousos, & Kino, 2010; Yang et al., 2006).  After a relatively short duration of abnormal circadian rhythmicity, these changes in the body’s metabolism manifest as elevated levels of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood, insulin resistance, obesity, fatty liver, and hypertension (Nader, Chrousos, & Kino, 2010; Spiegel, Leproult, & Van Cauter, 1999). Like those with BD-I who have aberrant circadian rhythms, individuals who must constantly reset or stress their circadian rhythms are at risk for developing obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome (Boudebesse et al., 2015; De Bacquer et al., 2009; Gale et al., 2011; Gan et al., 2015; Karlsson et al., 2003; Kroenke et al., 2007; Morris et al., 2015; Scheer et al., 2009 Spiegel, Leproult, & Van Cauter, 1999), which predispose these individuals to developing cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke (Hermansson et al., 2007; Muller, Tofler, & Stone, 1989; Puttonen, Harma, & Hublin, 2010). Further complicating things, suboptimal sleep may undermine efforts at weight loss (Chaput & Tremblay, 2012; Borel et al., 2012). With regards to oxidative stress, individuals with BD-I have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of antioxidant defense than healthy controls across all phases of the disorder (Anderson & Maes, 2015; Bengesser et al., 2015; Versace et al., 2014). This is likely related to aberrant circadian functioning (Faraut, Bayon, & Leger, 2013). Further, individuals with BD-I are more susceptible to cellular damage from oxidative stress than healthy controls exposed to similar levels of it (Andreazza et al., 2013).  Inadequate sleep may affect eating behavior by increasing appetite (Gonnissen et al., 2012), especially in regards to hedonic food cues (Benedict et al., 2012; St-Onge et al., 2012), and extend exposure environmental cues that promote poor dietary habits (Terre, 2014).\n\n     As Soreca (2014) points out, the increased oxidative stress and vulnerability to cellular damage from it may begin to explain the high level of psychiatric comorbidity in BD-I. Approximately one-third of individuals with BD-I have an active comorbid anxiety diagnosis and about one-half have had an anxiety diagnosis over their lifetime (Simon et al., 2004).  Along with substance use disorders, anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric comorbidity in BD-I (McElroy et al., 2001). Given that there is mounting evidence to suggest that oxidative stress may predispose individuals to anxiety disorders and contribute to their course of illness (Bouayed, Rammal, & Soulimani, 2009; Hovatta, Juhila, & Donner, 2010; Rammal et al., 2008; Salim et al., 2010), it is feasible that circadian dysfunction and its associated increases in oxidative stress in BD-I may underlie the vulnerability of this population towards developing anxiety disorders.\n\n     Taking a closer look at their sleeping patterns in BD-I reveals several characteristics.  The delayed phase in sleep onset where one falls asleep later and wakes later occurs frequently in BD-I (Ng et al., 2015; Seleem et al., 2014). This sleeping pattern is known to result in sleep deficits (Kohyama, 2011).  While this is the most common phase shift in BD-I, some experience the opposite circadian dysfunction of an advanced phase shift, which is more likely to be seen in older BD-I individuals (Mansour et al., 2005). These differences appear to reflect differences in genetic makeup (Lee et al., 2010), as well as prognosis, with those with advanced phase shifts being more likely to have had their most severe depressive episode last longer (Mansour et al., 2005). Other characteristic sleeping patterns exist in BD-I. Those with BD-I are more likely to wake up in the middle of night, and show greater variations in their sleeping patterns (Ng et al., 2015).  BD-I is also associated with less stability to their time to bed and awakening time relative to controls, with these differences are often affected by mood state (Seleem et al., 2014).\n\n     Notably poorer sleep quality remains a characteristic feature of BD-I during remission. Sadly, 70% of remitted BD-I report insomnia (Harvey et al., 2005).  Those in remission wake up in middle of the night more frequently than otherwise healthy Americans who are experiencing insomnia (Geoffroy et al., 2015). Relative to healthy controls without insomnia, people with remitted BD-I experience increased daytime sleepiness, sleep variability, and latency until sleep (Geoffroy et al., 2014).  In addition to the aforementioned psychiatric and medical comorbidities associated with circadian rhythm dysfunction, insomnia during euthymia increases the risk of relapse and suicidality (Sylvia et al., 2012).\n\n     Sleep problems undermine psychosocial functioning in BD-I. In an extensive review, Boland and Alloy (2013) conclude sleep disruption predisposes a person with BD-I to cognitive deficits and/or exacerbates neurocognitive deficits throughout the course of illness. Sleep deprivation has been shown to undermine cognitive evaluation of emotional stimuli such that one processes information and more readily interprets something as negative relative to baseline (Tempesta et al., 2010). This would hinder socialization by promoting keeping one’s distance or failing to be as friendly as would otherwise be the case.  Walz and colleagues (2013) found levels of daytime sleepiness and disturbances in sleep to be an independent predictor of functionality/degree of disability. Further, Giglio and colleagues (2010) found disturbances in biological rhythms as assessed by the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment of Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) to more accurately predict functional status than the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test in BD-I. Kohyama (2014) found “late sleep onset can reduce sleep” and represents a “sleep/circadian disturbance” that “may cause brain impairment,” which can result in developing problems in social behavior.\n\n     It has become increasingly recognized by mental health experts that managing sleep complaints in remitted BD-I is an important component to their overall treatment (Wang et al., 2014). Assessing disturbances or abnormalities in sleep and other salient chronobiological features might one day serve as an important avenue for detecting BD-I and/or whom is most at risk, resulting in earlier diagnoses, and enhanced monitoring for predicting and improving the management of recurrent episodes (Robillard, Naismith, & Hickie, 2013). Harvey, Kaplan, and Soehner (2015a) notes that “Psychological interventions for sleep disturbance are advantageous in that they have few adverse effects, may be preferred by patients, are durable, and have no abuse potential.” Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has recently begun to garner attention as a potential intervention for BD-I (Steinan et al., 2014).  CBT-I is a very effective treatment in normal insomnia (Morin et al., 2006; Morin & Benca, 2012). While this intervention has been shown to help with sleep difficulties in BD-I, its effects are less robust, which is probably in part a function of there being substantially greater biological dysfunction to their circadian rhythms in BD-I (Kaplan & Harvey, 2013; Steinan et al., 2014).\n\n     A recent study by Harvey and colleagues (2015b) compared a modified version of CBT-I tailored to people with bipolar disorder to psychoeducation.  The modified CBT-I differed from conventional CBT-I in several salient ways (Harvey et al., 2015b). For example, there was a “brisk wake-up” strategy along with scheduling activities and daily goal setting to reduce extended time in bed upon awakening.  Some instructions such as only go to bed when feeling tired were modified to reduce risk of inadvertently promoting evening goal-seeking behavior that would undermine opportunities for sleep.  Components from Interpersonal and Social Rhythms Therapy were also integrated to regularize daily activities.  Astonishingly, they found the modified version of CBT-I to be a substantially more effective treatment for bipolar disorder. The sample treated with modified CBT-I spent dramatically fewer days in a bipolar episode (3.3 verse 25.5 average days), corresponding with significantly lower relapse rates (4.6% verse 31.6%), with that difference especially pronounced in rates of relapsing into mania or hypomanic (4.6% versus 31.6%). Harvey and colleague’s (2015b) modified CBT-I’s particular association with a reduction in risk of manic relapse likely speaks in part to how interventions teaching people with BD-I how to gain better control of their sleep is likely to reduce the risk of mania more than depression. However, this study’s protocol for CBT-I included teaching “dark therapy” where exposure to light is severely limited (Barbini et al., 2005), which when used during prodromal manic symptoms of disrupted sleep was also likely a salient component behind how this intervention dramatically reduced the risk of manic relapse.\n\n     The two most effective mood stabilizers (lithium and Depakote) have been shown to correct some forms of circadian dysfunction through known chronobiological mechanisms (McClung, 2007). Studies have shown an individual’s responsiveness may relate to the specific ways that differing genetic profiles result in unique profiles of circadian rhythm pathology (Campos-de-Sousa et al., 2010; McCarthy et al., 2011; Szczepankiewicz et al., 2011). Further, melatonin has been shown to promote sleep and circadian rhythmicity (Arendt, 2000). Melatonin receptor agonists having been shown to help attenuate bipolar depression (Calabrese, Guelfi, & Perdrizer-Chevallier, 2007; Eppel, 2008; Fornaro et al., 2013) and melatonin agonist having been shown to enhance efforts at relapse prevention (Norris et al., 2013). Also, N-acetyl cysteine, which is a powerful antioxidant that should ameliorate some of the oxidative stress in BD-I and may thereby promote normalcy to circadian rhythms (Dean, Giorlando, & Berk, 2011; Hardeland, Coto-Montes, & Poeggeler, 2003), has been shown to alleviate depressive symptoms in BD-I (Berk et al., 2008). Similarly, the light therapy typically used for seasonal affective disorder has shown to have beneficial effects in bipolar depression (Dallaspezia, Suzuki, & Benedetti, 2015)."
    
    static let stigmatization = "Stigmatization describes a separation of individuals who are labeled as different from “us” and believed to possess undesirable traits that result in adverse emotional reactions, discrimination, and loss of status for the stigmatized person (Link et al., 2004).  Structural stigma (e.g., explicit and implicit exclusionary practices), social stigma, and self-stigmatization adversely impacts the quality of life for virtually all people living with serious and persistent mental illness, with bipolar I disorder being no exception (Farrelly et al., 2014; Hawke, Parikh, & Michalak, 2013; Suto et al., 2012).  A recent study by Brohan and colleagues (2011) found that about 1 in 5 people living with BD-I report a moderate or high degree of self-stigmatization while about 3 in 4 report a moderate to high degree of perceived stigma.  Further, the presence of self-stigmatization or perceived stigma has been shown to be associated with poorer overall functioning (Cerit et al., 2012; Thome et al., 2012; Vazquez et al., 2011).  The Surgeon General’s report on mental health found stigma to be a salient barrier discouraging people from seeking treatment (Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General, 1999), consistent with recent findings (Latalova et al., 2013).  Although stigma as a barrier in this context is likely to relate in part to internalized negative views derived from one’s family, friends, and society, it also likely reflects how those who do seek treatment often encounter mental health workers who have deeply held devaluing beliefs around those with mental illness (Cohen and Struening, 1962; Hawke, Parikh, & Michalak, 2013).  Perceived stigma by mental health workers is likely an important factor behind why, among those with affective illness, receiving inpatient treatment was associated with significantly greater impact of stigma on the individuals’ quality of life (Suto et al., 2012; Switaj et al., 2014).\n\n     Concerns about stigma have also been shown to impede meaningful social interactions with people outside of one’s family (Perlick et al., 2001).  Suto and colleagues (2012) found for many people with BD-I attributed stigma to why they observed a multitude of friends opting to cut them out of their life upon receiving their diagnosis.  Studies also suggest individuals with mental illness may tend to withdraw from social interactions on account of having internalized the negative or discriminatory attitudes of society at large to the point of anticipating judgmental responses and rejection around their diagnosis (Link et al, 1989, Link et al., 1987).  With regards to remitted BD-I, Aydemir and Akkaya (2011) found these individuals to have very high levels of social anxiety, which seemed causally related to self-stigmatization.  Within the context of intimate relationships, Sarisoy and colleagues (2013) found internalized stigma in BD-I to be associated with lower relational satisfaction and increased fear of relationship and relational anxiety.\n\n     The stigma associated with having BD-I is pervasive enough to become internalized and perceived by caregivers and family members (Gonzalez et al., 2007).  Caregivers believe around 70% of individuals with BD-I experience stigma in the form of devaluation of the individual by most people aware of their diagnosis, while 43% believe that most also devalue their family members (Struening et al., 2001). Suto and colleagues (2012) used the following quote to epitomize the kind of social stigma endured by family members: “If my child had leukaemia you would all be bringing me lasagna” (p.1).  Further, Steele, Maruyama, and Galynker (2010) found approximately 1 in 2 caregivers for those with BD-I report being depressed, which appear to be closely related to their experiences with stigma.  Furthermore, there appear to be certain depressive symptoms that family members and caregivers experience that appear to be especially unlikely to manifest in the absence of stigma (Perlick et al., 2007).  Then, while the mood status of the person with BD-I affects the likelihood and extent that family and caregivers experience stigma, studies have consistently found significant levels of stigma associated with caregivers of those with remitted BD-I (Gonzalez et al., 2007)."
    static let impulsivity = "     Many studies have linked the severity of impulsivity in individuals with BD-I to a higher likelihood of psychosocial impairment, lower quality of life, longer duration of illness, history of psychosis, and increased risk of suicidality (Ekinci et al., 2011; Jimenez et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2012; Najt et al., 2007; Peluso et al., 2007; Strakowskiet al., 2010; Swann et al., 2001a; Swann et al., 2003; Swann et al., 2009b; Victor, Johnson, and Gotlib, 2011).  Yet despite its salience in understanding the nature of not just BD-I but a wide variety of psychological disorders, there remains no explicit, widely agreed upon, clinical definition of impulsivity (Moeller et al., 2001; Stahl et al., 2013).  This lack of a cohesive construct for impulsivity complicates navigating the literature on impulsivity in BD-I.  In its broadest sense, impulsivity can be conceptualized using Moeller and colleagues (2001)’s definition of “a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli with diminished regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individual or to others.” (p.1784).  While spontaneity describes a proclivity towards spur-of-the-moment decisions or behaviors that are benign in terms of their risk to oneself and others, impulsivity describes a tendency to suddenly act with an undue disregard to their potential destructive or dire consequences.\n\n     While Moeller and colleagues’ definition provides a good starting point, it fails to highlight how impulsivity is distinct from compulsiveness.  Unlike compulsive behaviors that are characterized by a repetitive, automatic, independent of outcome, and habitual nature, impulsive action is goal-directed and motivated by strong drives to obtain a desired outcome (Balleine & O’Doherty, 2010; Jentsch et al., 2014).  In fact, some describe impulsivity as not inherently pathological in nature because it is often associated with being highly motivated to obtain adaptive outcomes such as social dominance (Fairbanks et al., 2004), important resources for survival (Volkow et al., 2013), and sex (Charnigo et al., 2013; Cummings et al., 2013; Hayaki, Anderson, & Stein, 2012) to list some salient examples (Jentsch et al., 2014; Stevens & Stephens, 2010).  In many respects, understanding if and when patterns of impulsive behavior are problematic involves examining the extent to which it is maladaptive by looking at a type of risks taken, resultant distress endured by the individual and others, the degree to which the individual was unable to curb these behaviors despite earnest conscious effort or intent, and the disruption caused to one’s normal daily routine and functioning (Evenden, 1999; Jentsch et al., 2014).\n\n     The etiology and nature of impulsive behavior can vary considerably based on the individual and her psychosocial context.  For example, people with low levels of empathy may be at risk for impulsive behavior largely as a result of consistently experiencing substantially diminished feelings of guilt, remorse, and shame from previous transgressions and thereby experience diminished negative internal or subjective consequences from having potentially or actually harmed others (Alcorn et al., 2013, American Psychiatric Association, 2013c; Coid & Ullrich, 2010; Goldstein et al., 2006; Hare & Neumann, 2008; Lipperman-Kreda & Glicksohn, 2010; Morgan, Gray, & Snowden, 2011; Snowden & Gray, 2011).  Many others act impulsively primarily on account of having a vulnerability to becoming overridden by intense emotions that distort perceptions by diminishing awareness of potential harm and creating a heightened or excessive sense of urgency, often causing one to take unnecessarily swift or rash action (Cyders & Smith, 2008; Sharma, Markon, & Clark, 2013).  These two basic forms of psychopathology often exhibit salient differences in their motivation to try and curb any patterns of impulsive behavior.  The former group typically experiences less distress from their history of impulsiveness and therefore are often less likely to garner sufficient motivation to work on not acting impulsively unless forced to do so by sufficiently threatening external consequences.  In contrast, the latter group tends to more readily appreciate the problematic nature of their behavior in hindsight, having endured a barrage of negative emotions that may provide exaggerated feedback of the severity of their behavior.\n\n     Though psychoeducation around the biological nature of impulsivity may serve as a catalyst for motivating a person to work on overcoming their impulsivity, a biological predisposition towards becoming emotion dysregulated in BD-I appears crucially linked to how their impulsivity typically manifests (Ambrosi et al., 2013; Brooks et al., Buhle et al., 2013; Muhlert & Lawrence, in press).  This leads to rash behavior arising from being swept away with an intense positive or negative emotion when the individual’s decision-making capacity becomes impaired on account of having a diminished understanding of the risks involved.  The increased tendency for individuals with BD-I to become emotionally dysregulated may relate to being more readily combative or distant while encountering another in distress as maladaptive efforts to cope with substantially higher levels of stress that others are unlikely to have to endure in those situations (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009).  Unfortunately, this often means being less likely to be able successfully navigate many of the difficult interpersonal scenarios necessary for achieving high levels of functioning.\n\n     Fundamental to comprehending the nature of impulsivity in BD-I is not only having an appreciation of how this trait manifests differently depending on the individual, psychopathology, and psychosocial context, but an understanding of the ways impulsivity often varies according to mood status and symptom severity.  As most mental health professionals are aware and Moeller and colleagues (2001) point out in their review on impulsivity, it is “virtually impossible” for a manic episode not to involve impulsive behavior.  Some of the prototypical examples of manic symptoms described in the DSM-V include unrestrained and excessively fiscally irresponsible shopping sprees, cheating on one’s spouse, engaging in sexually promiscuous behavior without regard to sexually transmitted diseases or unwanted pregnancy, reckless driving, and so forth (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a).  Pathological impulsivity is considered such a hallmark feature of mania that the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for virtually every impulse control disorder specifies that their symptoms must not be better accounted for by a manic episode (American Psychiatric Association, 2013b).  The DSM-V further specifies that in order for any impulsive behaviors to constitute partial criteria of a manic episode, they must represent aberrations from the individuals’ baseline in terms of being novel, significantly more frequent, and/or severe (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a).\n\n     Yet there is substantial evidence to suggest that many with BD-I continue to struggle with issues pertaining to impulsivity during periods of euthymia and depression, which typically constitute much longer periods of their life.  Problematic impulsive behaviors occurring across mood states explains how individuals with BD-I have between a 4 and 9-fold higher rate of impulse control disorders (Bohne, 2010; Karakus & Tamam, 2011; McElroy et al., 1995). The vast majority of studies that relied on self-report measures (e.g., the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, BIS) found significant differences between those with BD-I and healthy controls with little variation in such differences between mood states, resulting in some characterizing impulsivity as more a trait rather than state-dependent component of BD-I (Lombardo et al., 2012; Najt et al., 2007; Peluso et al., 2007; Saddichha & Schuetz, 2014; Swann et al., 2001a; Swann et al., 2003; Swann et al., 2009a). These studies most commonly use findings from the BIS-11 to suggest that impulsivity may have similar features and/or severity levels across mood states in BD-I, yet may not have considered how the presence of subsyndromal symptomology during remission might unwittingly exaggerate the pathological nature of their impulsivity at that time. Lewis, Scott, and Frangou (2009) administered the BIS-11 to 106 bipolar participants, the vast majority being BD-I.  Using their response profiles from the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), investigators identified 36 euthymic individuals who were also not experiencing any subsyndromal symptomology.  This subgroup reported comparable levels of impulsivity on the BIS-11 relative to healthy controls.  These findings suggest that the presence of syndromal and subsyndromal depressive symptomology may intensify impulsiveness relative to a state of symptomless remission. Alternatively, the presence of depressive symptoms may influence participants towards providing an exaggerated account on self-report measures of the severity of their impulsivity resulting in an exaggeration of any true discrepancy relative to when the mood symptoms are not present.\n\n     While depressive symptoms may cause many participants to unintentionally exaggerate the severity of personal short-comings and psychopathology, studies have consistently found an association between depression and an increased tendency towards impulsiveness.  Corruble and colleagues (2003) assessed impulsivity using three self-report (i.e. the Impulsivity Rating Scale (IRS), the Impulse Control Scale (ICS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11)) measures on a sample of 127 psychiatric in-patients in the midst of severe unipolar depression, as well as at a four-week follow-up.  Their findings revealed significant and considerable elevations on each of the three scales at admission when compared to their follow-up scores when depressive symptoms had substantially attenuated, though considerable residual symptomology had persisted. Their follow-up response profiles appeared in many ways comparable to those of control samples from others studies (Perroud et al., 2011).\n\n     In some ways it seems counter intuitive that depressive symptomology may be associated with a considerable increase in impulsivity.  Depression is often characterized by diminished motivation for engaging in goal-oriented behavior, yet such a driving force appears to be a central, fundamental component of impulsivity without which impulsive behavior is much less likely to manifest (Balleine & O’Doherty, 2010; Jentsch et al., 2014).  Reconciling this apparent contradiction may mean appreciating how those grappling with depression may more readily harness the necessary motivation for particularly short-sighted and destructive acts that offer immediate relief from painful scenarios.  Tragically, at the extreme, this can mean attempting or committing suicide.  The vast majority of suicides in the developed world are committed by the affectively ill during a depressive episode (Nock et al., 2008), with BD-I being no exception (Marangell et al., 2006).  There is an abundance of research linking impulsivity to suicide (Bender et al., 2011; Gorlyn, 2005; Gvion & Apter, 2011; Horesh, 2001; Javdani, Sadeh, & Verona, 2011; Maser et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2009; Zouk et al., 2006), a relationship upheld in BD-I  (Corruble et al., 2003; Isometsa, 2014; Mann et al., 1999; Michaelis et al., 2004; Nock et al., 2008).  Though its relatively infrequent manifestation prevents it from being the most common mood state for committing suicide, the risk of suicide may actually be highest during a mixed episode (Balazs et al., 2006).  This elevated risk may be associated with higher levels of energy and activity fueling one’s proclivity towards acting impulsively while experiencing negative urgency.  Further, there is evidence to substantiate lithium being the most effective medication for preventing suicide in the BD-I population at large, which appears a function of it attenuating effect on impulsiveness (Baldessarini et al., 2006; Cipriani et al., 2013; Ernst & Goldberg, 2004; Halcomb, Gould, & Grahame, 2013; Muller-Oerlinghausen, 2001; Ohmura et al., 2012; Tondo & Baldessarini, 2009).  Adida and colleagues (in press) administered the Iowa Gambling Test on three samples: one taking lithium, another taking alternative forms of bipolar medication, and healthy controls. Results showed that those in the lithium group had significantly better decision making than the other participants with bipolar disorder, including not selecting cards that promised the possibility of a high pay off yet were associated with a very high risk of adverse consequences. In fact, studies have demonstrated that lithium remains a particularly effective agent at preventing suicide even in individuals with bipolar disorder, unipolar, and schizoaffective disorder who are non-responsive or only partially responsive to lithium’s mood stabilizing or antidepressant properties (Ahrens & Muller-Oerlinghausen, 2001; Baldessarini, Tondo, & Hennen, 1999; Baldessarini, Tondo, & Hennen, 2003; Guzzetta et al., 2007; Nilsson, 1999). These findings suggest substantial antisuicidal effects associated with lithium that are independent of how well it promotes remission of other symptoms, raising the possibility its capacity to enhance impulse control could be a more salient mechanism in how it helps prevent suicide in BD-I than how well it can attenuate manic and depressive symptomology.\n\n     The majority of the literature suggesting impulsivity is more of a state-dependent phenomenon than stable trait in BD-I looks at performance on neuropsychological behavior tasks (Adida et al., in press; Najt et al., 2007; Strakowski et al., 2010; Swann et al., 2001a; Swann et al., 2003; Swann et al., 2009b).  In addition to the possibility that self-report measures may yield results that exaggerate the degree to which impulsivity is a fixed trait in BD-I, it is quite plausible that neuropsychological testing may fail to capture the extent to which impulsiveness endures during euthymia due to limited ecological validity of the tests in BD-I.  It is a very different experience for a person with BD-I to engage in tasks in a research setting where she likely understands that her performance will not meaningfully impact her sense of self, life situation, or livelihood and therefore highly unlikely to cause substantial emotional dysregulation or arousal.  Given that states of heightened emotionality may play a far more significant role in the nature of impulsivity relative to many other types of psychopathology, neuropsychological tasks meant to assess impulsivity may not adequately engage the emotionality present during most of the real world situations where they would be most likely to engage in problematic behavioral patterns of impulsivity.\n\n     Muhtadie and colleagues (2014) administered multiple self-report measures of impulsivity to a sample of remitted BD-I and controls, including the BIS-11 and the Positive Urgency and Negative Urgency scales.  These two latter scales are designed to gauge respondents’ tendency to act impulsively while experiencing strong emotions (Cyders et al., 2007).  The largest group difference in terms of effect size was on the Positive Urgency scale, followed by the Negative Urgency scale, with the discrepancies on both measures representing about a 5-10-fold greater proportional difference in mean scores when compared to healthy controls than was seen on the BIS-11.  The authors conclude that individuals with remitted BD-I appear to be especially at risk for acting impulsively while experiencing strong emotions, especially positive ones.  Some authors highlight how impulsivity can vary according to whether it is sensation seeking or aimed at reducing distress (Norbury & Husain, 2015).  While BD-I is certainly associated with an elevated risk of the latter, these preliminary results found a higher predisposition towards the former.\n\n     Consider psychosocial interventions like Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) that focus on teaching people how to manage impulsivity primarily by helping them learn how to effectively navigate emotionally charged situations.  Though this intervention was originally designed for borderline personality disorder (BPD), it has become increasingly accepted as appropriate for BD-I along with an array of other disorders associated with a tendency towards emotional dysregulation and impulsivity (Goldstein et al., 2007; Jamilian et al., 2014; Neacsiu et al., 2014; Van Dijk & Segal, 2009). Preliminary research suggests that DBT’s effectiveness is much more closely related to the group component rather than individual psychotherapy (Gutteling et al., 2012).  Group setting may be more effective for this type of intervention because it more likely to provoke emotionally charged interpersonal scenarios that mimic many of the real world settings where the individual is more vulnerable to succumbing to impulsive behavior (Roney & Cannon, 2014).  Once the individual’s emotions are provoked, he or she can practice recently primed skills while receiving support from the facilitator and peers around what worked and the things they might have done differently.  Perhaps for the same reason that individual psychotherapy may not be particularly effective component in treating impulsivity in DBT, conventional research settings that rely on behavioral tasks to assess impulsivity in BD-I may be underestimating the severity of impulsivity, especially during remission and subsyndromal when states of heightened emotionality less readily manifest (Blair et al., 2007; Schreiber, Grant, & Odlaug, 2012; Tice, Bratslavsky, & Baumeister, 2001)."
    
    static let prognosis = "     Bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) spend about 20% of their lifetime in episodes, with 50% of episodes lasting between 2 and 7 months (median 3 months) (Angst & Sellaro, 2000).  Between episodes, about one-third of people with BD-I report having no symptoms, one-third report mild symptoms, and one-third report significant symptoms (Suppes et al., 2001).  Overall, people with BD-I are symptomatic (i.e. either experience a mood episode or subsyndromal symptoms) during one in every two weeks and experience depressive symptomology during one in three weeks (Judd et al., 2002).  In one study, 16.8% of individuals with BD-I who had received treatment for 15 years or longer and then followed for 2-years were found to show a poor prognosis in terms of having persistent mood episodes (Tsai et al., 2001). Another longitudinal study found one in five hospitalized bipolar patients had a poor long-term outcome indicated by the presence of mania or depression throughout the 15th year of follow-up, with active alcoholism and low levels of optimum functioning in the preceding 5 years predicting an increased risk of having a poor prognosis. Further, the persistence of depressive symptoms in the first 2 years of follow-up predicted depressive symptomology 15 years later whereas a similar trend was not observed for manic symptoms (Coryell et al., 1998). Angst and Preisig (1995) found the mean length of mood episodes to be 4.3 months. A study looking at individuals with BD-I receiving treatment found the median duration for a mood episode to be 13 weeks with more than 75% recovering from their mood episode within one year (Solomon et al., 2010). A study in Thailand found the median time to remission from the start of a mood episode to be 67.5 (72.5 days for depressive episodes and 58.0 for manic episodes) (Leelahanaj et al., 2013).  This discrepancy in the length of a mood episode may relate to improvement in treatment over the last two decades leading to faster recovery.  Furthermore, when 182 people with BD-I were followed for approximately 17 years of illness, Marneros and colleagues (2008) found that most experience not only mood episodes, but also schizoaffective and schizophreniform episodes. Schizoaffective episodes are distinct from manic or depressive episodes in that they are immediately preceded or followed by a state of psychosis lasting at least two weeks that does not have sufficient mood symptoms to meet criteria for a manic or depressive episode (American Psychiatric Association, 2013d).  Schizophreniform episodes are periods of sustained psychosis that last between one and six months (American Psychiatric Association, 2013d).  They are distinct from manic, depressive, and schizoaffective episodes in there never being where enough manic or depressive symptoms manifest to meet criteria for a mood episode (American Psychiatric Association, 2013d).  Further, they found approximately one in four with BD-I experience predominately schizoaffective episodes while for 8% with BD-I characteristically relapse into schizophreniform episodes rather than manic or depressive episodes."
    
    static let theRelapseIssue = "Adults.\n\n     Bromet and colleagues (2005) found 42% of people with BD-I achieved complete remission by three months, 63% within six months, 75% within a year, and 84% within four years.  A prospective study looking at 1,469 outpatients with bipolar disorder found that 58.4% remitted within two years with 48.5% of them subsequently relapsing during that period, being twice as likely to experience a depressive episode (Perlis et al., 2006). A recent study conducted in Thailand found one-year relapse rates of 21.7% (Leelahanaj et al., 2013).  In a widely-cited study by Gitlin and colleagues (1995) that followed patients after their first manic episode hospitalization who were compliant with top-of-the-line pharmacotherapy found their rate of relapse to range between 40% and 60% within one to two years of an episode; relapse rate approached 75% by the fifth year.  Three-quarters of those who relapsed had done so within 2 years, and they had a mean time until relapse of 2.92 years (SD=2.52).  Of those who relapsed over a five-year span, two-thirds relapsed multiple times.  Close to half of those who did not relapse still showed periods of moderate manic or depressive symptomology, with only 17% of all patients maintaining a state of remission or minimally symptomatic throughout the follow-up.  Lower functioning individuals relapsed faster, as did those with more prior mood episodes. An increased number of depressive episodes were associated with more family and social disruptions than was seen with manic episodes (Gitlin et al., 1995).  In a naturalistic study setting where medication compliance was not guaranteed, 81% of those with BD-I had relapsed after 7 years (Keller et al., 1993).  Goldberg, Garno and Harrow (2005) found that in naturalistic treatment settings, 3 out of 4 individuals with BD-I demonstrated high relapse rates when followed-up for at least 5 years. In terms of those who fair worst, Turvey and colleagues (1999) found that when BD-I outpatients were followed-up annually for a decade, the 17% with the worst prognosis during years 8, 9 and 10 were increasingly likely to experience polyphasic (i.e. “rapid-cycling” or “mixed”) episodes relative to others with BD-I such that by year 7 they were 4 times more likely to have them the others.\n\n     Begley et al. (2001) estimated that half of individuals who have their first manic episode will go on to relapse an average of once every three years.  More than 10% will relapse at a rate of once a year; a quarter will fluctuate between periods of relapsing once every three years and at times relapsing every year, and an estimated 5% will never achieve a period of remission in his or her lifetime (Begley et al., 2001). This study used an analysis of money spent on treating bipolar disorder to conclude that only around 7.5% will achieve a lifelong remission.  Interestingly, these individuals were unlikely to remain compliant with treatment with 50% having terminated medications within three months of their manic episode. Begley et al. (2001) found those who achieved lifelong remission would also be unaffected by terminating treatment, which at the time would be most likely to be pharmacotherapy alone.  This is the only study to date describing those who have one manic episode and then achieve lifelong remission.\n\n     In terms of predictors of relapse, the presence and extent of subsyndromal depressive symptomology appear to predict relapse during the maintenance phase of remitted BD-I (Degenhardt et al., 2012).  Stressful life events are less predictive of relapse in BD-I than in unipolar depression, though major life events are better predictors of relapse when the prognosis has not become severe (Paykel, 2003).  With regards to manic verse depressive relapse, manic symptoms during recovery and proportion of days with elevated mood in the preceding years was associated with shorter time to relapsing into a manic, hypomanic or mixed episode while residual depressive or manic symptoms at recovery and proportion of days depressed or anxious in the preceding year were significantly associated with shorter onset of depressive relapse (Perlis et al., 2006). Additionally, high stress levels and lower levels of social support has been shown to predict depressive relapse within six-months and one year, though social support did not attenuate the adverse effects of stress (Cohen et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 1999). The BD-I population has been found to have among the highest lifetime rates of substance use disorder, with approximately 46% meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder and 41% with drug use disorders (Regier et al., 1990).  The high prevalence of substance use disorders is especially important when considering that the duration of alcohol abuse has been shown associated with length of depressive episode while the duration of cannabis abuse has been shown associated with duration of mania (Strakowski et al., 2000).\n\n     Rapid Cyclers.\n     BD-I with rapid cycling refers to individuals with BD-I who experience four or more mood episodes over the course of a year with episodes that are demarcated as distinct if there is a change in polarity (e.g., mania to depression) or at least a two-month interval of partial or full remission (American Psychiatric Association, 2013a).  This subpopulation is considered to have among the poorest prognosis and have high rates of non-responding to treatment (Calabrese et al., 2001).  Approximately 30% of individuals with BD-I have had at least one year of rapid cycling over the course of their lives, with around 15% of the BD-I population meet criteria over a given year (Schneck et al., 2008).  A prospective study looking at people who experienced at least one year of rapid cycling in recent years found that approximately 3 out 4 displayed rapid cycling during the first year of follow-up and another 12% began rapid cycling during the second-year of follow-up.  Of those who experienced rapid cycling, 4 out of 5 ended within two years (Coryell et al., 2003).  Rates of rapid cycling are remarkably higher in children and adolescents where approximately one in every two kids with pediatric BD-I are rapid cyclers (Findling et al., 2001).\n\n     Patients who are rapid cyclers are about 2-2.6 times more likely to make a suicide attempt, 30% more likely to make one or more serious suicide attempt, 50% more likely to experience dysphoric mania or hypomania, and 10% more likely to experience psychotic mood episodes than patients with non-rapid cycling BD-I (Coryell et al., 2003; Garcia-Amador et al., 2009; Kupka et al., 2005).  Over the course of a year, relative to non-rapid-cyclers, they spent about half as much time in remission, close to twice as much time in moderate to severe depression, and around 2.5 times as much time in moderate to severe mania, with 5 times more mood episodes for an average of 7.1 episodes and reaching about 10.5 for the worst 15% (Kupka et al., 2005).  On average, rapid cyclers have been found to have a younger age of onset, longer diagnostic delay, and experience both more mixed episodes during illness and atypical depression (Valenti et al., 2015).\n\n     Adolescents.\n     Of adolescents hospitalized for BD-I, 86% remitted within a year, of whom 54% had relapsed within one year post-hospitalization (DelBello et al., 2007). Poor syndromic recovery and/or relapse was predicted by co-morbid ADHD, alcohol use disorders, anxiety disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, nonadherence to psychotropic medication, lower socioeconomic status, treatment with antidepressants, and the absence of psychotherapeutic intervention. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to experience symptomatic recovery (DelBello et al., 2007).\n\n     Psychosocial functioning\n     Functional recovery has been consistently shown to lag syndromal recovery. A prospective, observational study of outpatient treatment over 2-years on 1656 BD-I patients found 64% achieved remission and 34% achieved functional recovery (Haro et al., 2011). For patients receiving an array of interventions and treatment, 58% achieved symptomatic recovery after six months and 34% reached functional recovery (McGorry et al., 1996).  Similarly, subsyndromal symptomology has also been shown to persist after syndromal remission.  Over the course of a year post-hospitalization, 48% of BD-I patients achieved syndromic recovery, 26% achieved symptomatic recovery, and 24% achieved functional recovery (Keck et al., 1998). In adolescents hospitalized for BD-I, 43% and 41% achieve symptomatic and functional recovery within a year of having been hospitalized (DelBello et al., 2007).  At an approximate 4-year follow-up for medication compliant BD-I patients, occupational functioning was found to be good for 28%, fair for 37%, and poor for 35% (Gitlin et al., 1995).  Naturalistic study found the number of previous depressive episodes, presence of psychotic symptoms during the last manic episode and Body Mass Index (BMI) at baseline the best predictors of functional outcome following a manic episode (Bonnin et al., 2015). The cumulative presence of mood symptoms was found to be a more sensitive predictor of psychosocial functioning than the number of relapses for first-hospitalized BD-I patients who were medication compliant and followed over a five-year span (Gitlin et al., 1995)."
    
    static let depressionTreatment = "     Best practices for treating bipolar depression include providing the standard of care pharmacotherapy, along with the close monitoring and management of side effects and comorbid conditions, appropriately referring patients to brain stimulation procedures (i.e. ECT and TMS), and integrating psychosocial interventions when appropriate.  When compared to Stephen and McHugh’s suicide rate of 7% over 13.5 years in BD-I in the early 20th century, a large bipolar sample receiving the modern day top-of-the-line treatment over an equivalent time frame can be extrapolated to have a suicide rate of roughly 2% (Dennehy et al., 2011). Yet even the rate of suicide for those receiving top-of-the-line treatment for bipolar disorder seems alarmingly high when compared to the suicide rate for similarly aged (i.e. non-elderly adults) individuals from the United States’ general population whose suicide rate is roughly 0.17% over this time frame (Al-Sayegh et al., 2015). With suicidal patients, treatment with lithium should be given special consideration (either alone or in combination) as research suggests it is the single most effective agent at helping to prevent suicide (Ahrens & Muller-Oerlinghausen, 2001; Baldessarini, Tondo, & Hennen, 1999; Baldessarini, Tondo, & Hennen, 2003; Guzzetta et al., 2007; Nilsson, 1999).\n     Best practices for the treatment of acute depression includes effectively overcoming barriers based on unfounded concerns associated with ECT, as well as adeptly addressing the risks of both short-term and long-term cognitive deficits. Additionally, best practices includes appropriately discussing with candidates for ECT the alternative of TMS, especially when ECT is refused or patients feel disinclined towards receiving that treatment despite receiving thorough and competent efforts to address all underlying concerns.  In addition, TMS should be readily offered when BD-I patient are at heightened risk of developing cognitive deficits from ECT (e.g., cases when they received ECT repeatedly or the elderly) or when their depression is not considered severe enough for ECT.  One study looked at the effects of giving TMS daily for 4 weeks as adjunctive treatment for 19 patients with bipolar depression and found 63% responded and 53% remitted with their depressive symptomology progressively attenuating each week, including on the follow-up assessment done one-week posttreatment (Harel et al., 2011). Another study that gave three weeks of daily TMS to 11 individuals as adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant bipolar depression and found 82% benefited from a reduction in symptom severity, 55% saw the presence and severity of their symptoms drop by at least half relative to baseline, and 36% remitted (Dell’Osso et al., 2009).\n     While the specific form of psychotherapy likely to be most effective is probably related to, at least in part, client and clinician preference, intensive psychotherapy has been shown effective in treating bipolar depression and should be given special consideration in all cases. Miklowitz and colleagues (2007a) found when those suffering from bipolar depression received intensive psychotherapy (i.e. Family-Focused Therapy (FFT), Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), or Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)) weekly for 9 months, they showed higher recovery rates, a greater chance of being clinically well, and shorter times to recovery when compared to those with bipolar depression who were given 3 sessions of psychoeducation (PE). The group who received intensive psychotherapy also had significantly improved functionality one-year post-treatment relative to those who did not (Miklowitz et al., 2007a). In their review of psychosocial treatment for BD-I (i.e. CBT, PE, IPSRT, FFT, cognitive remediation, and mindfulness-based interventions), Miziou and colleagues (2015) found there to be limited evidence supporting the usefulness of CBT in the treatment of acute depression, with the equivocal for IPSRT’s effectiveness.  All other interventions reviewed were either lacking sufficient research or deemed ineffective in the treatment of acute depression."
    
    static let maniaTreatment = "     Americans with BD-I spend an average of roughly 3% of their time in a manic episode, with episodes lasting an average of 3 weeks (Begley et al., 2001; Judd et al., 2002).\n\n     Modern day treatment of mania as it stands today. Around 30% of treated cases of mania result in inpatient psychiatric hospitalization (Begley et al., 2001; Judd et al., 2002).  Due to this higher rate of hospitalization, BD-I inpatients are more likely to be experiencing mania than depression despite the latter occurring being three times more frequently with longer episodes (Begley et al., 2001; Judd et al., 2002). Yet even though mania is the mood state most likely to result in psychiatric hospitalization, it is important to remember that the majority of cases are treated exclusively as outpatients.\n\n     Although there does not appear to be any literature on the trend in modern day prescribing patterns for treating acute mania in the United States, a conglomeration of inpatient and outpatient data used in Italy to treat mania is available as an estimate.  This data is from the European Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication (EMBLEM), a large-scale, multi-site, naturalistic observational study monitoring prescribing patterns for 2-years upon initial patient presentation for acute mania (Bellantuono et al., 2007).  Findings show that upon initial presentation of mania, approximately half of BD-I patients were prescribed two drugs, while roughly one-quarter were prescribed a single medication and the remaining quarter were started on at least three medications (Bellantuono et al., 2007).  When patients were prescribed monotherapy, Zyprexa made up half of cases while Depakote was the second most commonly prescribed medication, representing 15% of monotherapy cases. Lithium monotherapy was the fifth most frequently prescribed (6% of cases) and Seroquel was sixth (4% of cases). When two drugs were prescribed, Zyprexa was used as one of the agents in half the cases.  When three of more drugs were prescribed, Zyprexa was used in each of the 25% of cases where agents were specified.  Although it cannot be generalized to the United States with certainty, such widespread use of Zyprexa, especially when used as monotherapy over lithium or Seroquel is disconcerting for it does not conform to recent consensus guidelines based on efficacy research and health concerns (Ostacher et al., 2015).  These guidelines consider Zyprexa to be among the most effective options, along with a host of antimanic agents, except recommend it as a secondary option due to associated health concerns, including putting patients at higher risk of weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and movement side effects, i.e. extrapyramidal symptoms (Ostacher et al., 2015).\n\n     Data from the EMBLEM study also revealed that approximately 15% of cases of acute mania do not respond to 12-months of treatment as it stands today in Europe (Van Riel et al., 2008), which is likely an accurate estimate of the proportion of the American BD-I population who seek out but do not respond to a year of treatment for mania.  Findings from the EMBLEM study also revealed after 12 weeks of treatment as it currently stands for mania, approximately one-third of patients had recovered, while 20% never experienced at least a 50% reduction in manic symptoms and 5% of patients switch to a depressive episode (Tohen et al., 2010; Vieta et al., 2009).  Further, data from the EMBLEM study showed that 14% of European manic patients were prescribed antidepressants throughout their manic episode and therefore likely undermined the effectiveness of treatment (Rosa et al., 2010), with 14% likely serving as a rough estimate of American manic patients who are prescribed antidepressants to treat their manic episode.\n\n     Standard of care for the treatment of mania. For the purposes of this dissertation, the standard of care is defined as adherence to recent consensus guidelines for pharmacotherapy that are based on efficacy research and safety considerations (Ostacher et al., 2015). Additionally, the standard of care includes appropriate hospitalization based on being an imminent threat to oneself or others, as well as cases where insight and functionality has become excessively impaired to the point of posing a greater risk to longterm psychosocial functioning remaining in an outpatient setting than would be the case if removed from society temporarily via hospitalization. Finally, the standard of care should include the detection of delirious mania and other life-threatening forms of mania, along with the corresponding use of ECT to prevent physical exhaustion and mortality (Vanelle et al., 1994).\n\n     Best practices for the treatment of mania. In addition to meeting the standard of care, best practices should include the consideration of appropriate psychosocial interventions, the consideration of melatonin to promote regular sleep, and the integration of brain stimulation techniques (i.e. ECT and TMS) to treat nonresponders and rapid cycling (Medda, Toni, & Perugi, 2014).\n\n     Interventions aimed at attenuating circadian dysfunction and insomnia in manic patients are important considerations for virtually any manic patient. Dark therapy refers to limiting manic patients’ exposure to light, especially sunlight or any other source of UV lightwaves and blue light (Barbini et al., 2005; Phelps, 2008). When 16 BD-I manic inpatients were subject to 14 hours of enforced darkness from 6 p.m. until 8 a.m. showed a significantly faster reduction in manic symptoms when done within 2 weeks of hospitalization relative to those who received treatment as usual (Barbini et al., 2005).  Melatonin has been shown to help reduce manic symptoms and improve sleep in manic patients (Bersani & Garavini, 2000), and has the added benefit of reducing the metabolic side effects associated with antipsychotics (Romo-Nava et al., 2014). Finally, manic outpatients are likely to improve faster and reduce behaviors causing negative psychosocial consequences if provided with guidance from a plan created dyrubg remission that anticipates salient decision-making, as well as from feedback from family members, any treating psychotherapist, and close friends that helps them choose wisely which activities they can replace with quiet, calm, soothing ones or attempts to sleep (Alloy & Abramson, 2010)."
    
    static let maintenanceTreatment = "Maintenance therapy for Bipolar Disorder I (BD-I) refers to treatment during euthymia that aims to enhance quality of life through efforts to prophylactically prevent relapse, minimize affective symptoms, and promote optimum functionality. Although many do not receive maintenance treatment while euthymic, the American BD-I population as whole spends about 90% of their time remitted, of which about one-third they are symptomatic (Begley et al., 2001; Judd et al., 2002).//nBest practices for maintenance treatment of BD-I./n     Consistent with conclusions from expert consensus guidelines, the optimal management of BD-I should generally include the integration of psychosocial interventions (e.g., psychotherapy) with standard of care pharmacotherapy (Geddes & Miklowitz, 2013; Gitlin et al., 2006). Additionally, certain cases of BD-I may be most effectively and appropriately treated with adjunctive brain stimulation techniques (i.e. transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)) (Brunelin et al., 2010; Vaidya, Mahableshwarkar, & Shahid, 2003). Others may benefit from prescription or over-the-counter chronobiological agents (e.g., melatonin) and/or antioxidant agents (e.g., N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)) (Berk et al., 2012). Before exploring these various aspects of best practice maintenance treatment for BD-I in greater detail, it is important to consider how virtually each of these specific treatment options are likely to help certain subpopulations and presentations of BD-I more than others. As such, a lot of what constitutes providing best practices maintenance therapy as a clinician and treatment team is being aware of which option or options may be most appropriate based on any given person with BD-I and his or her specific presentation of euthymia. However, even when providing top-of-the-line care, clinicians may have to resort to a trial-and-error approach when definitive evidence around what would represent the best treatment tailored to the individual BD-I patient is lacking.\n\n     Best practices often entails the incorporation of psychosocial interventions, but clinicians should be aware that only certain interventions specific for bipolar disorder have proven to be effective during maintenance treatment (Miziou et al., 2015).  In their recent review, Miziou and colleagues (2015) found that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), family-focused therapy (FFT), cognitive remediation, and mindfulness-based interventions did not effectively prevent relapse and the evidence for interpersonal and social rhythm therapy ability to do so being equivocal.  The only intervention the authors found to have substantial evidence for long-last prophylactic effects was 6-month group psychoeducation with its effects primarily in preventing mania and for those in early stages of illness.  Another important aspect for clinicians to consider is that most interventions are better at preventing one type of mood episode over another, especially considering how around one in every two cases of BD-I having at least twice as many episodes in one pole over the other (Colom et al., 2006).  A review by Popovic and colleagues (2013) also found that group psychoeducation more effectively prevents mania than depression, consistent with findings from Miziou and colleagues (2015).  Popovic and colleagues (2013) concluded that there was enough evidence to conclude that CBT and FFT are effective enough to be considered as maintenance treatment option, and, along with individual psychoeducation, were much better at prevent depressive than manic relapses.\n\n    Providing maintenance ECT in order to prevent relapse in BD-I may, at times, be the most effectively and appropriate treatment option in instances where patients have been exhibiting rapid cycling bipolar disorder and/or high rates of relapse into depressive and mixed states (Medda, Toni, & Perugi, 2014). Minnai and colleagues (2011) treated 14 patients who exhibited treatment resistant, rapid cycling bipolar disorder for 21-months with 21-months of maintenance ECT. When compared to days ill over the two-year period preceding the treatment, these individuals showed a 13-fold decrease in their duration of illness (from 304 to 24 days ill per year) with the number of days free of symptoms increasing from 52 to 334 per year.  Further, 8 out of 14 patients did not relapse during the entire two-year treatment period while the other 6 relapsed once a year.\n\n     While ECT may represent an appropriate and effective treatment option for a significant portion of those seeking maintenance treatment for BD-I (and even more so during acute depression as will be reviewed later in this section), there are multiple salient adverse aspects associated with this treatment modality that undermine its potential use. The American lay public show a clear aversion overall to the idea of ECT being an acceptable psychiatric treatment option.  Lauber and colleagues (2005) surveyed 1737 Americans on their opinions about the use of ECT to treat schizophrenia and depression.  They found only 1.2% were in favor of its use while 57% considered it a harmful treatment. They found among the most common of reported concerns were perceptions that ECT is a brutal procedure that causes cognitive side effects or brain damage and used primarily to control unruly patients in a seemingly analogous fashion to how many view the one time commonly practiced procedure of the lobotomy.  Such a stigmatization of ECT appears to have been promoted in large part by film and the media (Euba & Curgel, 2009; McDonald & Walter, 2009), which has become so deep-seated into modern culture as to have an impact on medical students’ views of this form of psychiatric treatment (McFarqugar & Thompson, 2008). Stigma around the use of ECT continues to serve as a major hindrance preventing psychiatrists from providing the treatment to those for whom they believe it to be indicated and representing just as serious a problem for ECT today as it has over the past several decades (Dowman, Patel, & Rajput, 2005: Fink, 1998; Surya et al., 2015; Wilkinson & Daoud, 1998).\n\n     One can only appropriately refer to how ECT is viewed in a highly negative light by the majority of Americans as stigmatization if such perceptions are inaccurate. While its capacity to cause lasting brain damage and its modern day use being motivated by the intention providers inhumanely controlling patients rather than ameliorating their quality of life appears to be largely, if not entirely, unfounded concerns (Lauber et al., 2005), the issue of ECT causing long-term cognitive side effects remains contentious and unresolved not just with patients, their families, and within the medical community (Vaidya, Mahableshwarkar, & Shahid, 2003).  Consistent with the prevailing views of the medical community, Semkovska and McLoughlin (2010) reviewed data from 84 studies and 2981 patients who had been treated with ECT for depression and found significant declines in cognitive performance across multiple domains during the first three days following treatment, minimal deficits between the 4th and 15th day posttreatment, and no discernable differences in cognition from their baseline after 15 days had passed since treatment.  In contrast, MacQueen and colleagues (2007) compared the performance of 75 individuals with bipolar disorder who received ECT at least 6-months prior to 75 people with bipolar disorder who had never undergone ECT, as well as 75 healthy controls on a neuropsychological instrument (i.e. the California Verbal Learning Test) that has been well-validated at assess short and longer-term learning and verbal memory. On the majority of test’s parameters, participants who had had ECT performed significantly worse than both other groups, with non-ECT bipolar participants typically performing significantly worse than controls. Further, Weiner and colleagues (1986) found autobiographic memory deficits persisted six-months after receiving ECT, with the type of stimulus parameters used being associated with significant differences in the magnitude of this adverse effect on cognition and modern day use typically associated with the use of the more benign stimulus parameters.  In their review of 7 studies, Rose and colleagues (2003) found between 29% and 55% of patients who undergo ECT treatment believe they experienced long-lasting or permanent changes to their memory. A more recent study surveying 36 people who had received an average of 28 ECT treatment sessions with the last of these occurring an average of about 9 months prior found two out of three patients reported cognitive complaints despite these ECT techniques having been believed to be “memory sparing” (Sienaert et al., 2005).  While many reconcile the discrepancy between the frequent complaints of ECT-related cognitive impairment with meta-analytic findings failing to detect any lasting cognitive deficits to inaccurate subjective assessment, recent research suggests that ECT patients may be more accurate in their assessment of adverse cognitive effects than previously realized (Brakemeier et al., 2010).\n\n     In addition to any negative views of ECT that eligible patients for the treatment may share with the American lay public and even some within the medical community, many deny being adequately informed about the procedure by their treating psychiatrist. Individuals with BD-I who end up opting for ECT reported that they believed themselves not to have received adequate information about the procedure, as did their relatives (Virit et al., 2007).  This combination of stigma associated with ECT, uncertainty around the procedure’s potential for inducing lasting cognitive deficits, and the failure of clinicians to provide patients with a sense that they are informed around what receiving ECT entails represents serious concerns that have likely resulted in many with BD-I who would be most likely to benefit from treatment declining the option despite being in the midst of an acute and often dire psychological state.  Such resistance to ECT is reflected further in the finding that only one-third of depressed individuals who agreed to receive ECT believe it will help their condition (Brodaty et al., 2003).  Unfortunately, there are likely to be times when modern psychiatry’s inability to transcend these substantial barriers associated with providing ECT may represent the difference between life and death in the form of otherwise preventable suicides (Fink, Kellner, & McCall, 2014).\n\n     Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation procedure involving brief pulses of a magnetic field to a region of the brain to a conscious and anaesthetized patient making it much more readily tolerated than ECT with minimal side effects (McGirr et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 2009).  TMS offers several other important advantages to ECT. Namely, TMS is less stigmatized, does not put patients at risk of adverse cognitive effects but may actually promote improved cognition (Luber & Lisanby, 2014; O’Reardon et al., 2007).  Although the effectiveness of TMS as maintenance treatment is limited and often more appropriately consider during acute phases of illness, a case series of 6 patients with euthymic from recurrent major depression were being treated with ECT maintenance treatment then transition to TMS maintenance treatment (Cristancho et al., 2013). All six patient’s symptoms improved once transitioned to TMS.  Although the literature to date on the use of TMS as a maintenance therapy for BD-I appears limited to one case study, Bersani and colleagues (2013) describe a patient with BD-I and treatment resistant depression who had refused ECT then endured persistent and severe depression before being referred to the authors’ clinic in Italy for TMS.  He was given TMS daily for 20 days, then one session every other week for the subsequent 3 months.  His response was rapid, achieving remission by the second assessment on day 11 and maintained for the duration of treatment with residual symptoms progressively attenuating.  Further, his cognition and functionality immediately improved, with improvement proving to be consistent and sustained.\n\n      A final consideration for best practices is the adjunctive use of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). This agent is a powerful antioxidant that may help prolong the shortened lifespan in BD-I that may be secondary to the chronically elevated levels of oxidative stress (Brown, Andreazza, & Young, 2014; Park et al., 2015).  Additionally, a small, open-label 8-week trial of NAC for maintenance treatment was associated with an insignificant decrease in depressive symptomology, suggesting further research may substantiate a role in helping attenuate depressive symptoms during remission and prevent the onset of depression (Berk et al., 2012).  Another important consideration is the regular use of another powerful antioxidant, melatonin, to promote regular sleep (Adamczyk-Sowa et al., 2014; Soreca, 2014).  Although no studies to date have tested its use as a maintenance treatment, the ability of melatonin to promote the entrainment of circadian rhythms, which should help prevent both manic and depressive symptoms and relapse (Soreca, 2014)."
